    <p style="font-size:1.1em;">
      Some people treat science as a collection of facts. Thankfully, that's NOT what science is—because that would be really boring to study.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:1.1em;">
      Science is a <em>process</em>. Specifically, it's a process that allows a lot of very skeptical people to come to an agreement on the "whats" and the "whys" of the universe. Science isn't so much about what we know but HOW we know.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:1.1em;">
      Many teachers and websites break down the "scientific method" into a step-by-step list, but the truth is a lot more messy. The following graphic attempts to break down the "heart" of the scientific process:
    </p>
    <div style="text-align:center;">

    </div>
    <p style="font-size:1.1em;">
      In other words: gather as much experimental evidence as you can to support your claims (re-evaluate your claims if necessary), report your claims, get feedback from the scientific community, and then go back to gather more evidence.
    </p>
  </div>

  
  <div id="laws" style="background: #fff; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 10px; padding: 22px; margin: 22px auto; max-width: 900px;">
    <h2 style="color:#2d3b45; font-size:1.25em; margin-top:0;"><em>Laws and Scientific Theories</em></h2>
    <p style="font-size:1.1em;">
      All of science boils down to two questions:
      </p><ul style="font-size:1.1em; margin-left:18px;">
        <li>WHAT has happened (or is happening now or will happen in the future)?</li>
        <li>WHY has it happened? (Or is happening now or will happen in the future?)</li>
      </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p style="font-size:1.1em;">
      The answers to the first question are <strong>laws</strong>. Scientific laws describe the WHAT. In physics, these are always equations. The law of gravity allows scientists to calculate the gravitational attraction between two or more objects. Laws are always experimentally determined.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:1.1em;">
      The answers to the second question are <strong>scientific theories</strong>. CAREFUL HERE: a "theory" as defined by media is a guess or a hypothesis. A theory as defined by SCIENCE is an exceptionally well-tested explanation supported by massive amounts of experimental evidence. The theory of gravity is that space and time are warped by very large masses, which explains WHY gravity works but doesn't allow specific numerical predictions—you need the law of gravity for that.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:1.1em;">
      <strong>Both laws and scientific theories are VERY well tested and are the best answers to the WHAT and WHY questions that we have.</strong>
    </p>

  <div id="skepticism" style="background: #fff; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 10px; padding: 22px; margin: 22px auto; max-width: 900px;">
    <h2 style="color:#2d3b45; font-size:1.15em; margin-top:0;">Skepticism, Testing, and Change in Science</h2>
    <p style="font-size:1.1em;">
      Sometimes new tests are run that contradict a scientific law or theory. This is always super exciting! However, scientists are VERY SKEPTICAL types of people, so our first thought is almost always "the test must be wrong"—so we test and test and test some more. For example, a few years ago CERN collected experimental evidence that showed a particle moving faster than the speed of light, which is not possible according to all scientific theories. This would have meant a HUGE shakeup in our understanding of physics! However, after a LOT more testing, scientists concluded that there was a problem with the test.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:1.1em;">
      Sometimes we test and test and test and...realize that we have to let go of some really cool scientific theories. Michaelson and Morley spent three years (1902 to 1905) refining their experiments to discover the Earth's speed relative to the "luminiferous aether" that scientists thought filled space, only to realize that the luminiferous aether <em>doesn't exist</em>. Scientists ran more tests in the 1920s and even more tests in 2009 (with increasingly more sensitive equipment). By the 2009 test, no one still thought the luminiferous aether was a valid theory, but remember, the key to science is that we're never done testing.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:1.1em;">
      Scientist and writer Isaac Asimov once said: <br>
      <em>"When people thought the Earth was flat, they were wrong. When people thought the Earth was spherical, they were wrong. But if you think that thinking the Earth is spherical is just as wrong as thinking the Earth is flat, then your view is wronger than both of them put together."</em>
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:1.1em;">
      And now you should google "what is the shape of the earth".
