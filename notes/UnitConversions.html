  <h1 id="si">Units of Measurement</h1>
  <p>All SI (System International aka the metric system) units of measurement boil down to various combinations of seven basic units: seconds, kilograms, meters, kelvin, ampere, moles, and candela.</p>
  <p>For example, a unit of pressure that you may be familiar with is kPa or kilopascals. A pascal is a unit that is really just a quick way of writing: \( \frac{kg}{s^2 \cdot m} \). Don't worry, you don't need to know that for the test, it's just cool.</p>
  <p>But how do scientists decide how large each of these basic units should be? What are they BASED on? The definition of what constitutes "one" of each type of measurement has changed several times over the years!</p>
  <p>For example, in 1960, the International Weights and Measurement Committee defined one second as the fraction of \(1/31,556,925.9747\) of the year 1900. In 1967 they changed the definition again to be based instead off of vibrations of a cesium atom. The definition was updated again in 2019 to be even more specific about that vibration.</p>
  <p>What’s one kilogram based on? For a VERY long time, one kg was defined as the amount of matter in a very specific chunk of a platinum-iridium alloy housed in the vaults of the International Weights and Measures. This was deeply unsatisfying to some scientists so the definition of a kg has also recently been redefined. In 2018 the definition was changed to be based off of Planck’s constant (a constant that relates the energy of a photon to the wavelength of its associated light wave).</p>
  <p>The changing definition doesn’t affect everyday measurements but it absolutely affects scientists working in very high precision fields (aka: quantum mechanics, etc).</p>

  <h2 id="conversion">Unit Conversions</h2>
  <p>Why are there so many different ways to measure the same thing? Why have inches and feet and meters and miles and lightyears? Part of it is ease of reporting. Only very weird people want to know the distance between Tempe and Flagstaff in units of inches. Most people have an easier time visualizing 153 miles as opposed to 9,694,000 inches.</p>
  <p>Sometimes the different units are just because different countries and different organizations developed different ways of measuring things.</p>
  <p>All of which really means that scientists have to be able to switch back and forth between different measuring units.</p>
  <p>You may laugh but unit conversion can pose problems even among professional engineers.</p>
  <p>In 1999, NASA lost its $125 million Mars Climate Orbiter because of a failure to convert between metric and English measurement systems.</p>

  <h2 id="metric">Metric</h2>
  <p>Metric measurements use prefixes attached to the units that indicate factors of 10 differences in scale. This means that we can convert between different prefixes by moving the decimal left or right.</p>
  <p>The most common metric prefixes are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>T = tera = \(10^{12}\)</li>
    <li>G = giga = \(10^{9}\)</li>
    <li>M = mega = \(10^{6}\)</li>
    <li>k = kilo = \(10^{3}\)</li>
    <li>H = hecto = \(10^{2}\)</li>
    <li>D = deca = \(10^{1}\)</li>
    <li>b = base (no prefix) = \(10^0\)</li>
    <li>d = deci = \(10^{-1}\)</li>
    <li>c = centi = \(10^{-2}\)</li>
    <li>m = milli = \(10^{-3}\)</li>
    <li>u = micro = \(10^{-6}\)</li>
    <li>n = nano = \(10^{-9}\)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Examples of conversions and decimal movement follow this pattern.</p>
  <p>We can either use the prefix or the number the prefix represents. For example, we can say that we've traveled 2000 meters or (since k represents a factor of 1000) we can say we've traveled 2 km.</p>
  <p>Simply count up the factors of 10 between the two prefixes and move the decimal the same number of spaces. A movement from H to m requires us to move 5 positions on the above chart which means we have 5 factors of 10 between the units. Move the decimal 5 places. This means that 500 HL is the same as 50000000 mL. (the original two zeroes plus five more)</p>
<br>
<p>For example: How many Dg are in 3.4 cg? There are three factors of 10 between the two units so we'll move the decimal three places. There are 0.0034 Dg. </p>
  
  <h2 id="nonmetric">Non-Metric</h2>
  <p>Non-metric unit conversions are a bit more involved. We’ll use the fraction method (dimensional analysis).</p>
  <p>Example: Convert 0.05 miles to feet. (\(5280\ \text{ft} = 1.00\ \text{mile}\))</p>
  <p>\[\frac{0.05\ \text{mi}}{} \times \frac{5280\ \text{ft}}{1\ \text{mi}} = 264\ \text{ft}\]</p>
  <br>
  <p>You can chain conversions together too. Example: Convert 0.05 miles to meters (\(1.00\ \text{m} = 3.28\ \text{ft}\)):</p>
  <p>\[\frac{0.05\ \text{mi}}{} \times \frac{5280\ \text{ft}}{1\ \text{mi}} \times \frac{1\ \text{m}}{3.28\ \text{ft}} \approx 80.5\ m\]</p>

  <h2 id="density">Density as a Conversion Factor</h2>
  <p>Density relates mass to volume. For example, if a substance has a density of 8.0 g/mL, then:</p>
  <p>\[8.0\ \text{g/mL} = \frac{8.0\ \text{g}}{1\ \text{mL}}\]</p>
  <p>You can use this to convert between mass and volume using dimensional analysis.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Example: What volume does 3.5 g of a material with 8.0 g/mL occupy?</p>
  <p>\[\frac{3.5\ \text{g}}{} \times \frac{1\ \text{mL}}{8.0\ \text{g}} = 0.4375\ \text{mL}\]</p>

  <h2 id="practice">Practice</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>How many inches are in 0.25 miles? (5280 ft = 1 mile, 12 in = 1 ft)</li>
    <li>How many cubic meters does 805 g of a material occupy if its density is 0.15 g/mL? (1 mL = 1 cm³)</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Answers:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>15,840 inches</li>
    <li>0.0054 m³</li>
  </ol>
